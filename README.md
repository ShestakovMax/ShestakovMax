👋 Greetings, fellow web user, I’m @ShestakovMax. Thank you for your interest in my work. Hope you find it useful. Enjoy.

👀 Few statements that are true about me:
 - Knowledge is power that should be free and available for everyone. Вearers of wisdom should educate seekers of knowlege in exchange for commitment and      seriousness.
 - Work should bring joy and harmony. Every individual should perform activities based on natural aptitudes. Your ideal job is one that you gladly do for free.
 - If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.
 - Most people dont even come close to understanding its own potential. Just keep going, especially if you are going through hell. "Impossible" is just a worthy callange.
 - This world is a simulation. It is real, but we as souls does not belong to this world. Keep performing your duties and make it and all your life a sacrifice to The Lord.
 
🌱   Technologies used in my work: Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL and APIs. 
   - Key soft skills as a person: self-discipline, devotion to God, care for my family.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fantastic projects to make our everyday life better.
